              When you think about your average day, how much plastic do you think you use? Let’s say on the way to work, you get your morning caffeine fix from a steaming black coffee in a Styrofoam to-go cup. At lunch you run and grab
              a bottle of water and a few things at the grocery store and they send you on your way with your items tucked in a plastic bag. You get home late from work and order take-out that arrives with a set of plastic utensils and a straw for
              your soda. That is one day of plastic use, and for some, that’s a conservative estimate.</p>

            <p>Think back over the last week and for each slide, enter the amount of the plastic items you used for the week. At the end, you’ll see how you match up with the rest of the country!

          <h1>Plastic Bags</h1>
          <p> In 2014, it was estimated that a trillion single-use plastic bags were being used every year. What seemed like a sturdy solution to carting home groceries is making its way into our natural environment, choking livestock on farms and
            animals living in rivers, lakes, and oceans. During the 2015 Coastal Clean-Up Day hosted by the Ocean Conservancy, almost one million plastic bags were collected.</p>

          <p>Here’s how you can help:

            <ul>• Take your own reusable bag whenever you go shopping.</ul>
            <ul>• Buy fruits and vegetables that are not wrapped in plastic.</ul>
            <ul>• If you have to use a plastic bag, recycle it. In New York City, stores of a certain size must have collection bins for plastic bags readily available.</ul>
          </p>

          <h1>Plastic Straws</h1>
          <p>Straws have been in the news lately due to recent bans in cities around the world, as well as by corporations like Starbucks and Alaska Airlines. During the 2015 Coastal Cleanup Day, 520,000 straws and stirrers were collected from the
            beach. Straws are not biodegradable and can cause suffocation, stomach perforations, and death in animals that eat them.</p>

          <p>Here’s how you can help:

            <ul>• Drink from reusable straws made of bamboo or stainless steel.</ul>
            <ul>• Use biodegradable straws made of paper or compostable materials.</ul>
            <ul>• Use a reusable lid that does not require a straw, like an adult sippy cup.</ul>

          <h1>Styrofoam</h1>
          <p>Polystyrene, also known as Styrofoam, is mostly used for on-the-go food containers and packing materials, because it’s cheap, lightweight, insulative, and hard to break down. This last benefit of the product is what makes it so hard to
            recycle. If these items are not breaking down, they are piling up in landfills and being eaten by animals who mistake the small pieces for food.</p>

          <p>Here’s how you can help:

            <ul>• Use reusable containers and cups.</ul>
            <ul>• If you must use a one-time use container, try to use something made of compostable material.</ul>
            <ul>• When packing, try to use soft items from around the house, like towels or sheets, instead of Styrofoam peanuts.</ul>

          <h1>Water Bottles</h1>
          <p>Plastic water bottles that are thrown away end up in the water and make their way into the ocean. A study done by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation predicts that by 2050 there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish. The average amount
            of time it takes for one water bottle to degrade is 450 years, so even after your great-great-great grandchildren have died and biodegraded back into the Earth, that plastic water bottle you just threw out will still be around.</p>

          <p>It’s hard to quantify how many plastic utensils make their way into the streets, waterways and landfills each year. Utensils that make their way into the ocean can be lethal to marine life or cause serious injury. Turtles have been
            found with plastic forks lodged in their noses, which at the very least results in a painful removal process, and at worst, death.

          <p> It's difficult to pinpoint exactly how much plastic each individual consumes. According to EcoWatch, <b>the average American throws away an estimated 185 lbs of plastic per year.</b> Based on your responses for the week and the weights
            of individual items, it’s estimated that <b>your yearly plastic consumption
              is:</b>

          <p id="my_total"><b><span></span> lbs</b></p>
          <p> If you want to reduce your plastic use, you can start by trying to swap out just one of the types of plastic you use most often with a more sustainable option, whether it’s plastic bags, straws, Styrofoam, water bottles, or utensils.
            If you want to go bigger, try to replace them all! The environment and the animals will thank you! </p>
